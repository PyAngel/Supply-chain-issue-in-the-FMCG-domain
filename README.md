## _‚û°Ô∏èSupply Chain Issue In The FMCG Domain_
_Industry: Food, Dairy Products_

## ISSUE: 

Altiq Mart CEO is concerned about the non-renewal of product supply contracts with key clients. They are requesting the analytics team to conduct an investigation to identify the reasons why clients are unwilling to maintain their business relationship with the company.

## OBJETIVES:
- Try to obtain key performance indicators (KPIs) for logistic lines such as On Time, In Full, On Time In Full Ratio, in order to identify the problems that arise when shipping our orders

- Explore other metrics such as VOFR and LIFR, and try to filter by products, months, days, etc. It is important to create visual graphics to represent the metric vs. target during this exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Deliver our findings and critical points identified to improve our effectiveness ratios and strengthen our customer relationships to our CEO and Supply Chain Manager, in order to maintain a long-term business relationship.

## DATA:

Our data engineering team has delivered six datasheets in .CSV format containing all logistic supply chain information. This information was recorded during fiscal year 2022 and is distributed as follows:

- Dim_customers: This table contains all the information about customers
- Dim_date : This table contains all the information about the products
